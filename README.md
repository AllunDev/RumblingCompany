A configurable client-side mod adding [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/) support to the game.


*A huge inspiration and a great reference to this project has been [LethalVibrations](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/LethalPlugging/LethalVibrations/) which does the same thing as this mod.*
